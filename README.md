# Ames-House-Price-Prediction

**Introduction**  
 Determining the sale price of a house is often complicated due to the sheer number of variables that influence pricing decisions. However, with enough data, we can create a linear regression model that can help in determining the most important features of a home and accurately predict housing prices.

**Objective**  
Objective of this project is to find the key factors that plays a mojor role in predicting house price.

**About this dataset**  
Ames House Pricing is a popular dataset from Kaggle.This dataset contains 79 explanotary variables which discribes almost all the features of each house. It contains two dataset train data and test data. Train data to analysis and visualize the facotrs that plays key role in house price and test data to predict the house price using model evaluation.   
Here's a brief version of what you'll find in the data description file.
